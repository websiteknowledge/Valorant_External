This is a project I’ve been working on — an external cheat. It’s very simple, but surprisingly effective 👍. There’s no menu yet, though I’m planning to add one in the future. For now, a few settings can be adjusted directly inside the code ⚙️.



While it can work in other games, it was specifically designed for Valorant because of the purple outline 🎯. Yes — it’s a color‑based aimbot and trigger bot. If you want to use it elsewhere, you’ll need to change the target color or modify the code entirely.



🚫 Please do not use this in public games to gain an unfair advantage.

📚 This project is for educational purposes only.



If you want to test it, avoid online matches and use a game’s firing range or practice mode instead.



⚠️ I am not responsible for any bans, penalties, or consequences.

Use it at your own risk — and I hope you enjoy experimenting with it 🙂.



Instructions

1️⃣ Pre-requirements



You’ll need Python installed. I used Python 3.11, but other versions may work.



If you encounter issues, switch to Python 3.11. ✅



You also need this exact version logitech-g-hub-2021-10-8013 installed on your machine, make sure automatic updates are off in the setting and make sure it a running program when you launch the cheat, it works sort of like a spoofer and any newer version will not work.



💻 You may also need .NET Framework 4.8 Runtime installed, so make sure that’s available on your system as well.



2️⃣ Install Required Packages



Open Command Prompt and run:



pip install numpy opencv-python mss keyboard pythonnet





(It may say “already satisfied” — that just means the package is already installed 👍.)



3️⃣ Run the Program



After everything is installed, run:



python run\_cheat.py





⚠️ Important: Run Command Prompt as Administrator to avoid permission issues 🛡️
